			<p>
				As I continue my journey at La Trobe College and University, my main goal is to build a strong foundation in 
				programming and problem solving, and continuing to refine my skills to an advanced level as I progress. I intend to 
				become proficient in several languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, C++ and SQL. I also intend to explore
				deeper into HTML and CSS, and this portfolio will see many updates and improvements as I do so.
		
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Through my studies I aim to master the basics of programming and work on projects that challenge my critical 
				thinking with the intent to apply these skills effectively in a collaborative setting, preparing for real-world 
				applications.
			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Topics I am particularly interested in exploring during my studies are algorithms and data structures, optimising 
				them to be as efficient as possible; ethical hacking and the penetration testing and social engineering involved, 
				teaching me to think like an attacker in order to better protect systems from threats; as well as the rapidly 
				evolving realm of artificial intelligence, exploring natural language processing and machine learning to learn how 
				training can teach computers how to think like a human and make intelligent decisions.
			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				During my time in La Trobe University, I intend on applying for and hope to obtain an internship, gaining real-world 
				exposure into the software development industry, entering network opportunities, further developing my skills and 
				boosting my portfolio with relevant experience for when I finish my degree and start my career. By the end of my degree 
				I aim to have a strong skillset in the area of software development that aligns with my career path. Currently the 
				areas that pique my interest are mobile app development, game development and machine learning, however I am open to
				exploring new areas that I encounter as I progress through my studies.
