			Hi, I'm James Boussounis, born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and proudly come from a Greek heritage on both sides of 
			my family. Although I have only visited Greece and my family living there once, I treasure the experience deeply and am 
			longing to return again someday soon.
				<br>
				<br>
			From a young age, I've had a strong ability in problem solving, and have always embraced this through a love for puzzles, 
			maths, logical challenges and strategic games. I hope to continue to embrace this through a career in software development, 
			where I can apply my skills to real-world challenges.
				<br>
				<br>
			I'm currently studying a diploma of Cybersecurity at La Trobe College, with plans to continue my journey at La Trobe 
			University, pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology and majoring in software development. Whilst cybersecurity sparks my 
			interest with its rapidly growing industry and vast opportunities, my true passion lies in software development - where I 
			can tackle complex problems and formulate solutions that can make a real impact.
				<br>
				<br>		
			Outside of my studies, my hobbies include my love for puzzles - from Rubik's cubes and their variants to cracking variant 
			sudokus and the	occasional jigsaw. I also have a great appreciation for the outdoors, enjoying camping and a good hike, 
			as well as recent passion for skating. Proudly supporting the Carlton Football Club through their highs and lows, my 
			passion for the AFL has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember, both playing and as a fan.
				<br>
				<br>
			With a commitment for learning and refining my knowledge, I'm driven to push my capabilities to achieve my goals of 
			pursuing a career as a highly skilled software developer.
