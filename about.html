	<div id = "about">
		Hi, I'm James Boussounis, born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and proudly come from a Greek heritage on both sides of 
		my family. Although I have only visited Greece and my family living there once, I treasure the experience deeply and am 
		longing to return again someday soon.
			<br>
			<br>
		From a young age, I've had a strong ability in problem solving, and have always embraced this through a love for puzzles, 
		maths, logical challenges and strategic games. I hope to continue to embrace this through a career in software development, 
		where I can apply my skills to real-world challenges.
			<br>
			<br>
		I'm currently studying a diploma of Cybersecurity at La Trobe College, with plans to continue my journey at La Trobe 
		University, pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in software development. Whilst cybersecurity sparks my 
		interest with its rapid growing industry and vast opportunities, my true passion lies in software development - where I 
		can tackle complex problems and formulate solutions that can make a real impact.
			<br>
			<br>		
		Outside of my studies, my hobbies include my love for puzzles - from Rubik's cubes and their variants to cracking variant 
		sudokus and the	occasional jigsaw. I also have an great appreciation for the outdoors, enjoying camping and a good hike, 
		as well as recent passion for skating. Proudly supporting the Carlton Football Club through their highs and lows, my 
		passion for the AFL has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember, both playing and as a fan.
			<br>
			<br>
		With a commitment for learning and refining my knowledge, I'm driven to push my capabilities to achieve my goals of 
		pursuing a career as a highly skilled software developer.
